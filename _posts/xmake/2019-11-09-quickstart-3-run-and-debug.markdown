Xmake is a lightweight modern C/C++ project build tool based on Lua. Its main features are: easy to use syntax, more readable project maintenance, and a consistent build experience across platforms.

This article mainly explains in detail how to load and run the compiled target program, and how to debug.

### Run build target

xmake also provides a run command to directly run the generated executable file for quick and easy testing, for example:

```bash
$ xmake run
hello xmake!
```

#### Adding runtime environment variables

We can also add environment variables to set the default running target program through the `add_runenvs` interface in xmake.lua.

Therefore, for PATH, it is very convenient to append values ​​through this interface, and this interface supports multi-value setting, so it is usually used to set multi-value env with path sep. .

```lua
target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files ("src / *. c")
    add_runenvs ("PATH", "/ tmp / bin", "xxx / bin")
    add_runenvs ("LD_LIBRARY_PATH", "/ tmp / lib", "xxx / lib")
```

For more description of this interface, you can see the documentation: [add_runenvs interface documentation] (https://xmake.io/#/zh-cn/manual/project_target?id=targetadd_runenvs)






#### Custom run logic

If the simple environment settings and the default loading and running rules do not meet the requirements, we can customize the on_run script to achieve more complex running logic:

For example, run the installed apk program:

```lua
target("test")
    -- ...
    -- Set a custom run script, automatically run the installed app, and automatically obtain device output information
    on_run (function (target)
        os.run ("adb shell am start -n com.demo / com.demo.DemoTest")
        os.run ("adb logcat")
    end)
```

### Debugger

#### Command line debugging

We can also pass `-d` parameters, call debugger programs such as gdb / lldb, load the target file for debugging:


```bash
$ xmake run -d
```

xmake will use the debugger that comes with the system to load the program. Currently it supports: lldb, gdb, windbg, vsjitdebugger, ollydbg and other debuggers.

```bash
[lldb] $ target create "build / hello"
Current executable set to 'build / hello' (x86_64).
[lldb] $ b main
Breakpoint 1: where = hello`main, address = 0x0000000100000f50
[lldb] $ r
Process 7509 launched: '/ private / tmp / hello / build / hello' (x86_64)
Process 7509 stopped
* thread # 1: tid = 0x435a2, 0x0000000100000f50 hello`main, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame # 0: 0x0000000100000f50 hello`main
hello`main:
-> 0x100000f50 <+0>: pushq% rbp
    0x100000f51 <+1>: movq% rsp,% rbp
    0x100000f54 <+4>: leaq 0x2b (% rip),% rdi; "hello world!"
    0x100000f5b <+11>: callq 0x100000f64; symbol stub for: puts
[lldb] $
```

#### Breakpoint debugging with vscode

We can also use the [xmake-vscode] (https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-vscode) plugin to cooperate with vscode to implement breakpoint debugging support for c / c ++ projects.

In addition, we need to rely on the C ++ plug-in of vscode for debugging support, but since developing c / c ++ programs, this plug-in is almost necessary, so there is not much problem.

Even if this plugin is not installed, xmake-vscode will load the system debuggers such as lldb / gdb / vsjitdebugger, and directly load and debug.
